# Calculator Kata

Write a calculator that reads mathematical terms containing
floating point numbers, +, -, * and / as well as parenthesis. 

Calculate the result by applying the "usual" mathematical rules:

* operators are used in _infix notation_: `2 + 3`
* multiply/div have higher precedence then add/sub
* parenthesis have higher precedence then operators
* numbers can contain a mix of integers and floating point numbers
* calculation should follow mathematical rules, i.e. `2 / 0` is an error and not
  something like `NaN` or `-Inf`

The calculator should

* calculate the result of a single mathematical expression (no matter how long)
* print the result in a human readable style
* report any error and refuse the calculation (error reporting style doesn't matter)
* handle arbitrary long terms (i.e. tens of megabytes of input) well (i.e. in 
  terms of memory usage as well as running time)

# Specification of the input language

The calculator processes input that is read as `UTF-8` encoded characters. A 
formal specification of the input language is defined by the following [EBNF]:

```ebnf
(* An expression defines the start of the production. *)
expr = number | ( expr, S, operator, S, number ) | ( "(" S, expr, S, ")" );

(* The list of available operators. *)
operator = "+" | "-" | "*" | "/";

(* Definition of a number - either 0.xyz or abc.xyz *)
number = zero_fraction | non_zero_fraction;
non_zero_fraction = non_zero_digit { digit } { "." digit { digit } };
zero_fraction = "0" { "." digit { digit } };
non_zero_digit = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";
digit = "0" | non_zero_digit;

(* Any whitespace used as a separator including none. *)
S = "" | { " " | "\n" | "\t" | "\r" | "\f" | "\b" } ;
```

## Examples

The following lines are all valid input sequences:

```
0
0.123
807.1328
17 * 19
(21 - 3) * 8
```

# Testcases

A couple of test files with increasing sizes are provided in [`testdata`](./testdata). The results are
